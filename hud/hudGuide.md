Guide for the OpenCollar Owner HUD  Vers. 2.0

􀀀

􀀁
_______________________________________

The HUD is designed to be attached to any point of your HUD. Attaching it to the two center positions might get in the way, but if you were really limited on HUD attachpoints, you could manually edit/move its position off to the sides. 

ALL HUDs may be slightly hidden when attached on the bottom three attach points.  This is due to the limitation that HUDs are positioned by the corner of the users screen rather then the raised menu bar.  (This is especially evident when the user uses an alternative viewer like "CoolViewer." ) 
>> To fix simply right click and edit the position slightly.  The Owners HUD is smart enough to not reset your manual adjustments unless you reattach it to a new attach point.

Subs get added to the Owner HUD automatically by the database which the HUD queries on attach. 
This means, when you become the new owner of a sub, you have to update the HUD by hitting the [Reload Subs] button.
*note: If a sub does not show up, you have to be re added to the sub's collar once.
You can also be removed as a subs Owner by clicking [Remove Sub]

Chat commands (default channel is 7):
/7menu  -> opens the hud's menu
/7couples -> opens the hud's couple animation menu
/7hug name -> will ask name to accept a hug 
(available couple anims are: hug, kiss, hugsub, kissfoot, lickboot, jumphug... where the animations are opposite the one ones in the collar!)
/7channel x -> changes the hud listen channel to x (where x has to be > 0 )

======

The 6 HUD Buttons: (Left to Right when at default setting)

1) Leash - (chain symbol) Leashes ALL subs around you (where you have collar access, including group and open access) to you.
2) Couples Animations (silhouette of a couple) Opens the couples animation menu.
3) Cage Rezzer - (round cage) Searches for RLV enabled AV's, presents a menu, then summons a cage on the chosen AV.  The victim has the normal RLV accept/refuse type options.
4) Teleport Subs - (arrow down) Sends a tp command instantly if you have a single sub or pops up a sub select menu if you have multiple.
5) Main Menu - (square menu sheet) Opens up the HUDs main menu.
6) Dock/Hide - (nadu girl) Docks/hides the five buttons. Pressing it again will undock/show the buttons.

======

<<The HUD Main menu:>>

[CollarMenu] - Opens ALL collar menu's from your subs around.
[Couples] - Opens the couple animation menu to choose an animation.
[Spy] - Opens the spy menu to set spy settings.
[Subs] - Gives you a menu with a list of your subs and a button to dump the list into chat.
[TP] - Opens the tp menu. 
[Options] - Opens the new 1.7 HUD style/position/order options.

>Subs - menu:<
[List subs] -  dump the list of subs into chat
[Remove Sub] - removes the sub from the HUD AND removes you as owner from the sub's collar
[Reload Subs] - reloads subs you are owner of from the database 

>TP - Menu:<
[AutoTP On] - Opens a menu to choose which subs or if all subs shall follow your tps.
[TP Now] - opens a choice of locations to teleport your subs to.
You can add up to 10 Landmarks for locations to the HUD, just drop them into the HUD's content

To be able to use the HUD's TP features you have to ensure two things:
1) RLV is turned on at the subs collar 
2) when using any command with the hud while you are in a different sim than your sub, the sub's collar has to have the "Remote turned on"
# Remote is by default disabled and only the collar wearer or Owner can turn it on:
Example: Greta Grumpsalot's prefix is gg so her owner types "ggremoteon" 
and the collar returns the line "OpenCollar - 3.200 remote on!"

>Options - Menu:<
[Horizontal] - Aligns the buttons in a horizontal layout.
[Vertical] - Aligns the buttons in a Vertical layout. It will position the buttons in a horizontal plane when attached to the "top" or "bottom" HUD attach point automatically.
[Textures] - Opens a sub menu to select textures for the buttons.
[Tint] - Shows up when the non-glossy white texture is selected.  Works like the coloring on cuffs/collars. May also reset to default.
[Order] - Allows re-ordering of the buttons. May also reset to default.

The RLV viewer by Marine can be found at http://www.erestraint.com/realrestraint/   
*** Please be aware that for the submissive,RLV, the Restrained Life Viewer, will make  restraints un-detachable and other restrictive Measures can be enforced. These are measures that can test your relationship between an Owner and a submissive.

Please remember that using RLV is something that You will need to have an open communication with your submissive about due to the amount of power exchanged between you and your submissive.  Is not to be be taken lightly as some are not comfortable with it and will need to grow into wanting to use RLV to enhance their Second life.  

We recommend the Owner and the collar wear / submissive take a few of the Intro to BDSM in SL classes offered around the grid and how to use RLV classes in SL if they are not familiar with the features of RLV to prevent misunderstanding and sour their hard found relationship.

Have Fun!
